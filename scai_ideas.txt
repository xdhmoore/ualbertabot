Ideas for bot improvements:
-------------------------------
 - use neural network or similar to choose build goal based on input about enemy and economy
 - Hidden markov models to make inferences about what the enemy has & is doing?
 - add ability to do strategic goals like: damage enemy's economy, kill specific units or buildings, block areas of the map
 - handle combat better? scenarios like drops, high-ground, chokes, harrass & cutting off enemy forces, etc.
 - add 3 big rules:
   - when enemy attacks -> defend
   - when enemy expands -> attack
   - when enemy defends -> expand
